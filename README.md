# CTF-Challenges
First attempt at a CTF challenge in a GUI
This is only the second file Ive mad. The first one I had set to private which was this game but set in a text based version using python 3.9 IDLE.
This version was created using Sublime Text 3. I found this editor to be much better then the generic IDLE released by python. 
The game did not come out as exactly as I had planned but its a working product and I'm happy about that. 
I'm definetly going to go back and make some changes to try and shorten the code in the future and clean it up a little bit.
This is only the first version of the game I have designed.
